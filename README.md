- Why Built This

After years of web development (HTML/CSS/JS/PHP) and some desktop experience with many, this project was our first hands-on Flutter app â€” designed not just to learn the framework, but also to build something actually useful and extensible for everyone.

It started with a simple percentage calculator, and evolved into a full offline toolkit with multi language support.

- To Run Locally

Make sure you're using Flutter 3.19+ with intl and shared_preferences added in pubspec.yaml
