# smartcalc

- Why Built This

After years of full-stack web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and .NET) â€” with a strong focus on WordPress over the past 13 years â€” and significant experience in desktop applications (including C#, Java), as well as deep involvement with relational databases like SQL Server, MySQL, and PL/SQL-driven systems, this project marks my first hands-on Flutter app.

SmartCalc was built not just as a learning exercise, but as a serious, functional, and fully extensible tool â€” designed to work seamlessly across mobile, web, and desktop environments.

It started with a simple percentage calculator, and evolved into a full offline toolkit with multi language support.
